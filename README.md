This is the Read me file for the linked data project. Must start by finding the datasets I'm going to use.

So this is the branched copy. *NOW MERGED*
1.Ill clone the branch on the home machine
2.alter it
3.commit and push this version up to git.
4.then merge on the home machine
=======
17.28 this is the newversion branch on home machine
=======

5.try to merge the branch with the master.


not sure the reasoning behind the number below,
appears for both merges. Do i need to keep it?
