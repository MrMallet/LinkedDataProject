This is the Read me file for the linked data project. Must start by finding the datasets I'm going to use.

So this is the branched copy. /////NOW MERGED
1.Ill clone the branch on the home machine
2.alter it
3.commit and push this version up to git.
4.then merge on the home machine
=======
17.28 this is the newversion branch on home machine
=======================

5.try to merge the branch with the master./////BRANCH MERGED
i think this is the 3rd edit, its from laptop to the master whilst the master on git has already been updated, commit and pushed on home machine
Using home machine for a quick edit and push back up to git
========================

Its easy how quickly this branching and merging can get quite messy.
Maybe it would be best to mark which changes have some from where or maybe best of leaving git do all of that.

Now need to check out going back to a previous commit or branch.
=======================

//On laptop, newversion has been merged with master, master hasnt changed at all. 
18/11.
1. alter the master and commit it. 
2. merge master with new version
3. maybe create new branches 
4. merge new branches after alteringthem 




not sure the reasoning behind the number below,
appears for both merges. Do i need to keep it?
